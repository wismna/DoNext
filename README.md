# DoNext

DoNext is an innovative task application.
You can create and arrange task lists, create, edit and delete tasks...
But the emphasis is not a long list, as the more you have to do, the less you actually do!

Instead, focus only on the first task on the list:
Swipe it to the left: it's done!
Swipe it to the right: "nexted!". It goes to the end of the list and you can work on the next task.
